## COVID-19 Maps

In this lab, we created two maps. One depicting the number of cases in different US States and the other depicting rates of cases.
We used data from from [The New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/43d32dde2f87bd4dafbb7d23f5d9e878124018b8/live/us-counties.csv)  thatincluded data from cases in 2020. The population data used for calculating the case rates is from the [2018 ACS 5 year estimates](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?g=0100000US.050000&d=ACS%205-Year%20Estimates%20Data%20Profiles&tid=ACSDP5Y2018.DP05&hidePreview=true). Both datasets are at the county level which we used the boundary shapefile from [the U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html).
